#summary On modularity

Based on some experiments with clustering algorithms, Newman's modularity
metric and the MoJoSim metric for comparison between decompositions, I've
made two observations.

First: there's no correlation between modularity and authoritativeness (in
fact, there is a weak _negative_ correlation). It means that algorithms based
on modularity optimization, such as Bunch, don't necessarily give the best
decompositions.

Second: Big systems are more modular than the average of the systems. Although
small and medium systems span a wide spectrum of modularities, big systems are
consistently more modular. So, for this specific class of systems,
modularization optimization may give good results.
