#summary First results brought by the computer cluster.

I've recently been given access to the cluster managed by the [http://wiki.dcc.ufba.br/Gaudi/ Gaudi] group at Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA). As soon as I could, I gave the computers some data to crunch. I wanted to evaluate the similarity between networks synthesized by different models and software networks (aka realism). To do so, I generated a lot of networks with many combinations of model parameters. Today I announce the first positive (and surprising) results. The BCR+ model, previously regarded as a model that produced non-realistic networks, was proven to generate networks that are similar to software networks. Among 9500 networks that were generated, it was shown that about 2000 networks are realistic. The next step is to study the parameters that gave birth to these networks. Another work in progress is the study of the other models: LF, CGW and Erdos-Renyi. See you!
